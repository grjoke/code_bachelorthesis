# Codebase of bachelorthesis about disturbed systems of differential equations

Code Repository of my Bachelorthesis at the "Potsdam Institute for climate impact research" and TU Berlin. The Bachelorthesis also can be found in this repository. 
The topic of the thesis was the "Influence of noise on collapse rate and oscillation of a low-dimensional world-earth model" and researched the influence of applied noise on a nonlinear system of differential equations. Therefore the system of equations was solved by using the python-library sdeint (https://pypi.org/project/sdeint/)

The shell-script clean.sh cleans up the working directory after usage, so it deletes all directorys and plot-files. 

The repository consists of different code-files for the statistical experiments i conducted. Each one of them produces some figures and also saves the results in a text-file for further usage.

There are also some other files, which contain the needed functions and are imported in the experiment files.
